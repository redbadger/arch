Web application framework for React.

## About

Arch is a single page web application framework using React as its
UI layer. Arch takes a functional style approach with central immutable state
architecture inspired by [Om](https://github.com/omcljs/om).

Arch applications are written in [LiveScript](http://livescript.net)
by default (read more about [the reasoning](docs/07-livescript.md)
behind the decision), they are fully isomorphic out of the box and
Arch comes with it's own Node.js based server, Webpack bundler
and a CLI to help you get started.

## Video

Watch Arch [introduction talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHNv1ymaXSU) by Viktor and Tiago at React London Meetup.

## Examples

For example code, see [demos from the introduction talk](http://github.com/charypar/arch-talk)
at London React Meetup.

## Get Started

Start by installing the Arch CLI

```
$ npm install -g arch-cli
```

Then create a directory for your new application and go inside

```
$ mkdir my-app &&Â cd my-app
```

You can then generate a new app by running

```
arch-cli init
```

and following the steps. When done start the application by running

```
arch-cli serve
```

your application is now running on <http://localhost:3000>.

## Configuration

Arch is configurable by environment variables or a `arch.config.js` / `arch.config.ls` file in your project root.

Hardcoded config (passed to arch.server) takes precedence over environment variables.
